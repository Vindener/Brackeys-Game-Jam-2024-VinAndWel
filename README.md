A girl with a cat ran away from home when she heard her parents quarreling over the move caused by some kind of “epidemic”. While wandering through the forest, she saw infected aggressive animals, so she decided to return home, but there she found not so simple enemies....

This is our first participation in a game jam, so the game may seem too simple and bugged to you
But we didn't calculate the time correctly, as we did it after work 
But we had a lot of fun making it together :D

In the distant future, we plan to finalize game with all the mechanics that we originally planned!
